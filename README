# MScProject

All scripts used in the MSc project can be found here.

charmm27.ff: the modified force field

mdps: .mdp files used for simulations

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for umbrella integration, force extraction and Bayesian quadrature

plumed files: scripts and files for biased simulations

protein: structure and topology of cadherin EC1

scripts: sub-divided into plastic and protein, used for system equilibration and putting plastic together with the protein

Usage:
1. Change the proj_path variable in the following scripts in your cloned repo, according to the actual path:
- scripts/optimize.py
- scripts/plastic/gen.sh
- scripts/prot_plastic/prep_prot_pl.sh
- scripts/prot_plastic/prep_umb.sh

2a. If you would like to use the automatic procedure of finding and evaluating new points using the Bayesian optimiser, copy the scripts/optimize.py script in your main result folder. Please make sure that the initial files needed for your polymer are there (see: scripts/plastic/example_inputs_ps). 
2b. You can also carry out simulations manually with pre-defined COM separation values, which can for example produce simple free-energy profiles for a given plastic length. For this, execute the following scripts in order:
- scripts/plastic/gen.sh
- scripts/prot_plastic/put_together.py
- scripts/prot_plastic/prep_manual_umb.sh
- scripts/prot_plastic/simulate.sh, you can use submit scripts from plumed_files/
- notebooks/integration.ipynb to get the free-energy profiles and block analysis
- notebooks/get_force.ipynb to get the force profile and values for the optimiser / Bayesian quadrature

3. To get a 3D dependence of both COM separation, as well as the plastic length on the free-energy using Bayesian quadrature, follow quadrature.ipynb.
Good luck!:)
